I was given free reign on my General Assembly final project, and my first thought was having recently purged my fridge of food that had been in there too long and gone bad. Why was I relying on my own memory to keep track of such things, when computers (like the Android phone that lives in my pocket) are so much better at remembering?

From there, I figured automatic interaction with a shopping list and the ability to list general tasks/obligations were natural extensions. Although I didn't accomplish all of my near-reach goals, the project ended up being a solid, polished proof of concept, which I am continuing to develop.

The program features:  
- Google Firebase, for realtime synchronization and cloud-storage. 
- BlueLine Labs' Conductor, a lightweight, third-party replacement for Android's overly-complicated Fragment architecture. 
- A strong emphasis on abstraction and encapsulation, for ease of code-legibility, maintenance, and ongoing development.
