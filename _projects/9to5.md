A Google Now-style widget app done as a group project, providing calendar, weather, MTA delays, and news headlines
all on one screen. On top of the assigned usage of RecyclerViews and CardViews, I:
- Created the calendar widget, retrieving events from the calendar as a Content Provider and allowing them to be shared using a Sharing Intent.
- Designed app architecture/abstraction and assisted teammates in implementing that architecture.
- Implemented the (inaptly named!) SimpleXML parser for MTA status information.
- Built infrastructure for the Weather notification, including AlarmManager.
